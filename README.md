# ClientServer
This is a Pyhton code that allows the user to modify a database with a client server relation. 

There are 3 files : A client file, A server file and a text file that holds the database

First, you should run the server file, and then, when the server file is running, run the client file in a new instance.

You will be prompter by a menu with choice to modify the database, you can take a look at the text file to see how the
data is written. 
For your information, this is the model for each customer : name|age|address|phone 
It is possible that a client has an information missing, but the name will always be present. 

The menu holds many options :
Find a customer, add a customer, delete a customer, update a customers age, update a customers address, updates a customers phone
or simply print the report of all the data of customers. Finally, you can always exit. 

Note : this code is case sensitive, therefore when looking up a customer "john", it is best to type john and not John.

Enjoy!
